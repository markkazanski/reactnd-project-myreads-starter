{"books":[{"title":"The Hatred of Poetry","authors":["Ben Lerner"],"publisher":"FSG Originals","publishedDate":"2016-06-07","description":"No art has been denounced as often as poetry. It's even bemoaned by poets: \"I, too, dislike it,\" wrote Marianne Moore. \"Many more people agree they hate poetry,\" Ben Lerner writes, \"than can agree what poetry is. I, too, dislike it and have largely organized my life around it and do not experience that as a contradiction because poetry and the hatred of poetry are inextricable in ways it is my purpose to explore.\" In this inventive and lucid essay, Lerner takes the hatred of poetry as the starting point of his defense of the art. He examines poetry's greatest haters (beginning with Plato's famous claim that an ideal city had no place for poets, who would only corrupt and mislead the young) and both its greatest and worst practitioners, providing inspired close readings of Keats, Dickinson, McGonagall, Whitman, and others. Throughout, he attempts to explain the noble failure at the heart of every truly great and truly horrible poem: the impulse to launch the experience of an individual into a timeless communal existence. In The Hatred of Poetry, Lerner has crafted an entertaining, personal, and entirely original examination of a vocation no less essential for being impossible.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780374712334"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0374712336"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":96,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":74,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3HtCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3HtCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s3HtCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s3HtCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-s3HtCgAAQBAJ","id":"s3HtCgAAQBAJ"},{"title":"A Poetry Handbook","authors":["Mary Oliver"],"publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","publishedDate":"1994","description":"Offers advice on reading and writing poetry, and discusses imitation, sound, the line, poem forms, free verse, diction, imagery, revision, and workshops","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0156724006"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780156724005"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":130,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":6,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.1.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fuBHMccJx6UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fuBHMccJx6UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fuBHMccJx6UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fuBHMccJx6UC&dq=poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Poetry_Handbook.html?hl=&id=fuBHMccJx6UC","id":"fuBHMccJx6UC"},{"title":"Pattern Poetry","subtitle":"Guide to an Unknown Literature","authors":["Dick Higgins"],"publisher":"SUNY Press","publishedDate":"1987-07-01","description":"Pattern poetry—poetry from before 1900 that fuses literature and visual art—has existed since the times of ancient Crete and Egypt. Less well known than modern visual poetry, pattern poetry has been produced in most European and American literatures, and, as close analogues, in many oriental literatures. This book tells the history of pattern poetry, documenting and classifying more than 2,000 works. Illustrations of each major genre of pattern poem are included. The book also explores related forms, such as graphic music notations, shaped prose, sound poetry, and poetic labyrinths, to name a few. A glossary, essays by two world authorities on the oriental analogues to the pattern poem, and the first full bibliography on pattern poetry complete the work. With this book, Dick Higgins has provided an indispensable tool for opening up the area of pattern poetry to the scholar and the lay reader alike, bringing order to what has been an obscure and confusing area, and delighting the eye and mind by casting light on these forgotten treasures.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0887064140"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780887064142"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":275,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.0.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2-se6s6Jfn8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2-se6s6Jfn8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2-se6s6Jfn8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2-se6s6Jfn8C&dq=poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Poetry.html?hl=&id=2-se6s6Jfn8C","id":"2-se6s6Jfn8C"},{"title":"The Poetry of Robert Frost","subtitle":"The Collected Poems, Complete and Unabridged","authors":["Robert Frost","Edward Connery Lathem"],"publisher":"Macmillan","publishedDate":"2002-04-01","description":"This definitive, paperback edition brings together more than three hundred fifty of Frost's poems, each one with annotations providing complete bibliographic information and noting any textual changes","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0805069860"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780805069860"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":607,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Poetry"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KtComZirYE4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KtComZirYE4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KtComZirYE4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KtComZirYE4C&dq=poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Poetry_of_Robert_Frost.html?hl=&id=KtComZirYE4C","id":"KtComZirYE4C"},{"title":"The Poetry of A.K.

Since its debut in 1988, The Best American Poetry has become a mainstay for the direction and spirit of American poetry. Each volume in the series presents the year’s most extraordinary new poems and writers. Guest editor Sherman Alexie’s picks for The Best American Poetry 2015 highlight the depth and breadth of the American experience. Culled from electronic and print journals, the poems showcase some of our leading luminaries—Amy Gerstler, Terrance Hayes, Ron Padgett, Jane Hirshfield—and introduce a number of outstanding younger poets taking their place in the limelight. A leading figure since his breakout poetry collection The Business of Fancydancing in 1992, Sherman Alexie won the National Book Award for his novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. He describes himself as “lucky enough to be a full-time writer” and has written short stories, novels, screenplays, and essays—but he is at his core a poet. As always, series editor David Lehman’s foreword assessing the state of the art kicks off the book, followed by an introductory essay in which Alexie discusses his selections. The Best American Poetry 2015 is a guide to who’s who and what’s happening in American poetry today.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781476708218"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1476708215"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":240,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Poetry"],"averageRating":3,"ratingsCount":12,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.7.6.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NUEjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NUEjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NUEjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NUEjBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-NUEjBQAAQBAJ","id":"NUEjBQAAQBAJ"},{"title":"The Random House Book of Poetry for Children","authors":["Jack Prelutsky","Arnold Lobel"],"publisher":"Random House Books for Young Readers","publishedDate":"1983","description":"More than 550 poems by American, English, and anonymous authors.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780394850108"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0394850106"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":248,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Nonfiction"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":9,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.1.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zLF_sKMUYS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zLF_sKMUYS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zLF_sKMUYS8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poetry&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zLF_sKMUYS8C&dq=poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Random_House_Book_of_Poetry_for_Chil.html?hl=&id=zLF_sKMUYS8C","id":"zLF_sKMUYS8C"}]}
